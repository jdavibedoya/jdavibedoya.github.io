### 🎨 The Goal
This project implements the **Neural Style Transfer** (NST) algorithm, originally proposed by [*Gatys et al.* (2015).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

NST is a deep learning optimization technique that combines the **content** of one image *C* with the **style** of another image *S*. The goal is to generate a new image *G* that preserves the structural content of the first while adopting the artistic texture and appearance of the second.
