### 🎵 Project Overview

This project explores the intersection between **Artificial Intelligence** and **Music Composition**. I built an **LSTM Network** to learn musical grammar and stylistic patterns from MIDI files. While the architecture is flexible enough to train models on any MIDI dataset, the primary goal here was to create a coherent fusion between two iconic themes from the saga: *"Aerith's Theme"* (FF VII) and *"To Zanarkand"* (FF X).

### ⚙️ Technical Implementation

* **Sources:** Manually curated MIDI files.
* **Custom Musical Grammar:** Designed a tokenization system to interpret music as a sequence of events (`NOTE_ON`, `NOTE_OFF`, `DUR`).
* **Data Augmentation:** Implemented a tonal transposition pipeline to enrich the dataset, allowing the model to learn relationships across different keys.

### 🎧 Listen to Samples

The following samples were generated by the AI and rendered in a DAW (**Ableton Live**) with *Sound Magic Piano One* and *Valhalla Vintage Verb*.
